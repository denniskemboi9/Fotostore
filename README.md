#### Fotostore enables sharing photos with others in an easy, efficient, and organized way. Prior to the emergence of photo sharing platforms, sharing photos required physically sending or showing them to others, which could be time-consuming, costly, and inconvenient.

#### With photo sharing platforms, people can quickly and easily upload photos to a central location, where they can be accessed by others with permission. This enables people to share their photos with a larger audience, such as friends, family, or even the general public, without having to individually send them to each person.

#### Photo sharing platforms also provide a way for people to organize and store their photos digitally. With the ability to tag, categorize, and search for photos, people can easily find the photos they want to share, or revisit memories from the past.

#### In addition, photo sharing platforms often provide tools for editing, enhancing, and sharing photos, which can further enhance the user experience. Overall, photo sharing platforms address the problem of efficiently and effectively sharing photos with others in the digital age.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
